# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
This repo started as a planning/bootstrap repo for an AI study club Discord learning bot.
It now includes early runnable scaffolding alongside the product, architecture, schema, and ops docs.
Keep changes minimal, traceable, and aligned with the docs.

## Current State
- Main contents are `README.md`, `FILE_TREE.md`, `docs/*.md`, `src/`, and `scripts/`.
- `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` exist for the initial Python scaffold.
- The checked-in Python tree currently lives under `src/bot`, `src/services`, `src/repositories`, `src/models`, and `src/core`.
- `FILE_TREE.md` should be kept in sync with the implemented structure.
- Ignore `.DS_Store` and `._*` files.

## Product Priorities
Optimize in this order: accuracy, learning experience, traceability, operational simplicity. This is a learning service, not just a notification bot.

## Read Before Larger Changes
Read the relevant docs before implementing:
- `README.md`
- `docs/PRD.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/DISCORD_BOT_SPEC.md`
- `docs/CONTENT_PIPELINE.md`
- `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
- `docs/OPERATIONS.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/LINUX_OPENCODE_SETUP.md`

For DB, grading, publishing, scheduling, or workflow changes, read the matching doc first.

## Non-Negotiable Domain Rules
- Keep `discussion_prompt` separate from graded quiz data.
- Never expose `answer_key`, `accepted_keywords`, grading logic, or unrevealed explanations in public Discord messages.
- Store source metadata structurally, not as one display string.
- Preserve internal ID to Discord ID mappings.
- Treat trend/research briefs without sources as blocked or admin-review only.
- Keep public feedback aggregated; detailed grading belongs in ephemeral responses or DMs.

## Preferred Stack
Use Python 3.11+, `discord.py`, SQLAlchemy + Alembic, SQLite for local dev, PostgreSQL for production, and Linux deployment with `systemd`/cron.
All secrets must come from environment variables.

## Target Layout
Follow the implemented `src/bot`, `src/services`, `src/repositories`, `src/models`, `src/core`, and `scripts/` layout from `README.md` and keep Discord interaction, business logic, data access, and content generation separate.

## Build, Lint, Test Commands
Use the commands below for the current scaffold unless explicit tooling config changes them.

### Environment Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -U pip
```

### Dependency Install
If using `requirements.txt`:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
If using `uv` instead:
```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Run The App
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m bot.app
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/publish_daily.py
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/bootstrap_sqlite.py
```

### Lint, Format, Types
```bash
ruff check .
ruff format .
mypy src scripts
```

### Full Test Suite
```bash
pytest
```

### Single Test Commands
Use one of these exact forms:
```bash
pytest tests/path/test_file.py
pytest tests/path/test_file.py::test_function_name
pytest tests/path/test_file.py::TestClass::test_method_name
pytest -k "keyword" tests/path/test_file.py
```

### Focused Test Runs
```bash
pytest tests/services
pytest tests/db
pytest tests/bot
pytest --maxfail=1 -x
pytest -q
```

## Workflow
- Plan first for new features, schema changes, grading changes, pipeline changes, or deployment changes; direct implementation is fine for small commands, copy tweaks, tests, logging improvements, and simple refactors.
- Update the relevant docs whenever behavior, schema, architecture, or operations change, and keep changes incremental.

## Code Style Guidelines

### Imports
- Group imports as standard library, third-party, then local.
- Prefer absolute imports from top-level packages.
- Avoid wildcard imports.
- Keep imports side-effect free where practical.

### Formatting
- Follow PEP 8 and default `ruff format` behavior.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Prefer an 88-character line length.
- Keep functions small enough that control flow is easy to scan.
- Add comments only for non-obvious decisions.

### Types
- Use type hints by default for new code.
- Annotate public functions, methods, and module-level constants.
- Prefer explicit domain models over loose `dict[str, Any]` when shape is known.
- Use `TypedDict`, `dataclass`, or Pydantic models for structured payloads when helpful.
- Keep Discord-facing payloads and DB models explicitly typed.

### Naming
- Use English for code identifiers, module names, and filenames.
- Use Korean for most user-facing strings.
- Use `snake_case` for functions, variables, and modules.
- Use `PascalCase` for classes and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Prefer domain terms such as `content`, `quiz`, `attempt`, `publish_log`, and `user_stats`.

### Design
- Keep Discord UI handlers thin; move logic into services.
- Encapsulate DB access in repository/service layers.
- Separate grading, publishing, retrieval, and rendering concerns.
- Make retry behavior and duplicate-submission policy explicit.
- Prefer pure functions for normalization and scoring rules.

### Error Handling And Security
- Fail loudly for invariant violations; fail gracefully for user-facing operational issues.
- Never swallow exceptions silently.
- Log enough context to debug: action, content ID, quiz ID, user ID, Discord message ID, and exception details.
- Do not log tokens, webhook URLs, answer keys, or sensitive grading details.
- Make writes affecting grading and attempt history as atomic as practical.
- Secrets must come from environment variables only.
- Never hardcode bot tokens, webhook URLs, or API keys.
- Never leak answer data into public embeds, command output, logs, fixtures, or docs.

## Testing Expectations
- Add or update tests for grading, duplicate handling, stats aggregation, and repository/service logic.
- Prefer service/repository tests over brittle Discord UI mocks, and add a regression test first for bugs when practical.
- Keep fixtures free of real secrets and answer leaks; if no test harness exists yet, say so clearly in the final note.

## Documentation Sync Rules
Update the matching docs when these areas change:
- DB tables or fields -> `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
- Commands, buttons, modals, or interaction flows -> `docs/DISCORD_BOT_SPEC.md`
- Architecture or service boundaries -> `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Deployment or runtime operations -> `docs/OPERATIONS.md`
- Scope or MVP definition -> `docs/PRD.md` or `docs/ROADMAP.md`

## Cursor And Copilot Rules
At analysis time, no repository-level agent rule files were present:
- No `.cursorrules`
- No `.cursor/rules/`
- No `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

If any of those files are added later, treat them as first-class instructions and merge them into future edits of this file.

## Practical Reminders
- Start from the docs, be explicit about data-model and ops impact, and prefer incremental scaffolding over giant one-shot implementations.
- When introducing tooling, add the config files and update this `AGENTS.md` with the exact commands.
